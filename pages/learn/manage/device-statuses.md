# Device statuses

The application overview page shows the status of each device in the application.

Each device can have one of the following statuses:

| Status | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Online | The device is connected to the VPN and is communicating with the cloud within the correct interval. See [device connectivity](#device-connectivity) for more details on the possible Online states. |
| Configuring | The device is applying OS configuration. |
| Updating | The device is updating to a new application release. |
| Offline | The device is offline and is not connected to VPN and has not any recent API communications. |
| Post Provisioning | The device has been [provisioned][device-provisioning] but has not yet come online. |
| Inactive | The device has been [deactivated][deactivated] or has been [preregistered][preregistered] but has not yet connected to the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} API. |
| Frozen | The device has been frozen because it's outside the organization's allowance, or is in a paid [application type][application type] on a free tier organization. |

## Device connectivity

In addition to the device status, there are indicators to show if the device is having any partial connectivity issue. These indicators can be used to identify common issues, such as a firewall blocking VPN traffic or an inability of the device to communicate with the {{ $names.cloud.lower }} API.

| Status | Description |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Online (VPN Only) | The device is connected to the Balena VPN which provides remote SSH connections. |
| Online (Heartbeat Only) | The device is sending requests to fetch the target state within the configured [API polling interval][poll-interval]. |

**Note:** If the device is powered off or loses all network connectivity, it will remain in the Online (Heartbeat Only) state until the last target state fetch exceeds the polling interval.

## Debugging Device Status

If you find your device to be displaying a status which is unclear even with the above notes, visit the [device status][debugging-masterclass#device-status] section in [device debugging masterclass][debugging-masterclass] for more information and what it means for your application.
