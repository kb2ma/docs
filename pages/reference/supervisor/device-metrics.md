# Device Metrics

The {{ $names.company.lower }} Supervisor reports metrics about your device to the cloud. These metrics are available on your balenaCloud dashboard, on the device summary page:

![Device Metrics](https://www.balena.io/blog/content/images/2020/09/device-metrics-1.png)

You can also get device metrics data through [our open API](https://www.balena.io/docs/reference/api/overview/), which allows you to port this data to a custom dashboard to monitor the utilization and health of your fleet. Note that device metrics are available with {{ $names.os.lower }} v2.56.0+rev1 and higher, running Supervisor v11.14.0 and higher.

See the following table for details about each metric reported:

| Name                    | Type         | Description | API Slug | Optional? |
|-------------------------|--------------|-------------|----------|-----------|
| CPU utilization         | integer (%)  | Utilization percentage of the CPU. Receive updates when the "bucket" of the CPU usage changes past certain milestones in increments of 20%. | `cpu_usage` | Y |
| CPU temperature         | integer (Â°C) | CPU temperature in degrees Centigrade in boundaries of 3 degrees, subject to bandwidth saving transfer strategies. | `cpu_temp` | Y |
| Memory usage/total      | integer (Mb) | RAM usage on the device in megabytes. | `memory_usage` / `memory_total` | Y |
| Disk storage used/total | integer (Mb) | Utilized storage and total storage in megabytes. | `storage_usage` / `storage_total` | Y |
| CPU ID                  | string       | CPU serial number provided by manufacturer. | `cpu_id` | Y |
| Undervoltage            | boolean      | Detect power supply insufficiency. Not supplying enough power most commonly leads to power brownouts or disk corruption. Will *not* toggle back to false after true has been reported until reboot occurs. | `is_undervolted` | N |


## Toggling Metrics Reporting

In the table above, you may have noticed that some metrics are optional while others are not. From the perspective of the Supervisor, hardware metrics reported from the device are divided into two categories: optional system metrics, and non-optional system checks. Starting with Supervisor v12.8.0, you can control whether optional metrics are reported to the cloud to save bandwidth by toggling `BALENA_SUPERVISOR_HARDWARE_METRICS`. When metrics reporting is enabled, metrics are reported as part of device state at most every 10 seconds when metrics changes have occurred. When metrics reporting is disabled, optional metrics are not reported, but system checks are still reported. 

> Note: The `BALENA_SUPERVISOR_HARDWARE_METRICS` configuration variable may be toggled on an application or device-specific level from `Fleet Variables` or `Device Configuration` tabs on the dashboard respectively. By default, metrics reporting is enabled.
